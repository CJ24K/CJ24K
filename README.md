# Hello world, I'm Chris

An executive and marketing strategist in the insight and technology sectors, I have significant hands-on experience in growing profitable businesses, crafting exceptional cross-functional teams and developing highly effective marketing strategies. My successful track record has driven accelerated customer acquisition, helped create nationally recognised communication campaigns and been key to customer-centric innovations. Recently, I have acted in advisory capacities to firms seeking to align people, product and systems to create breakthrough growth in highly competitive industries.

Throughout my time as I marketer, I have retained my digital background and classical marketing education, but complemented this with deep experience in communications planning, brand management, go-to market strategy development and tactical execution. Over the past five years, I have been fortunate enough to help agencies, non-profits, local government organisations and private firms in the finance, technology and research spaces. Today, I am proud to be a part of the <a href="https://www.flexmr.net">FlexMR</a> leadership team, guiding the agency's international presence from strength to strength.

Passionate about understanding business purpose, diversity in tech, long-term sustainability, economic empowerment and food security. Enjoy table-top RPGs, writing fiction, geek culture, and travelling as much of the world as possible.

I also:
- Host the <a href="https://resources.flexmr.net/mrx-lab-podcast">MRX Lab Podcast</a>
- Publish musings on <a href="https://chrismartin.pro">marketing, strategy and leadership</a>
- Volunteer as part of the <a href="https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en">United Nations</a>
